            </h2>
            <p class="lead">I chose this topic because going into this assignment I did not know anything about Git, version control, or anything else for that matter. So to have a section break down exactly what version control is was really helpful! Version control is basically is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. I also found out that if you are a graphic designer or web designer, than this is a tool for you. Version control is helpful for this because you will always be able to retrieve files you accidentally deleted or edited. I also found it interesting that there are different types of version control like local, centralized, and distributed and each do something totally different from the last.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Short History of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Again, coming into this assignment seemed like a challenge because I had never heard of Git before. But through the reading, I was able to learn that “ Git began with a bit of creative destruction and fiery controversy.” Basically what had happened was Linux kernel and BitKeeperhad collapsed and the free of charge status that they had was taken away. Like any good failure, Linux learned their lesson and wanted to create a better tool based off of lessons learned the first time, and Git was born. What makes it so different is the speed, simple design, strong support, being fully distributed, and being able to handle large projects. With all these components, Git was able to be what it is today. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">So now that I know a little background information on Git, the next obvious question I had was what exactly is it? In short, “Git stores and thinks about information much differently than these other systems, even though the user interface is fairly similar, and understanding those differences will help prevent you from becoming confused while using it.” Basically Git has local operations, has integrity, and usually only adds data. However, the main thing Git has to offer are the three main states your files stay in. There is committed, modified, and staged. Aside from those three things, perhaps the most important thing Git has to offer is the Git directory. “This is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Account Setup and Configuration</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Out of all the readings, the one I found the most helpful was this one which told you exactly how to set up and configure your account. Starting out on a new website is never easy. It almost looks foreign to you and at times can be quite tricky to navigate. With this particular section, it gave you step by step (and picture) instructions on how to properly set up your account. Like I said earlier, this specific section was something that I had never heard of before, so having to configure anything on this website would have been nearly impossible without these helpful steps.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This specific section, like the last, was one that was really informative and very helpful! Without this section I would have had no idea what to do or what I was doing when dealing with this. This chapter pretty much covered every command that you need to know in order to be a pro at using Git. This chapter includes every step starting with getting your repository, initializing a Repository in an existing directory and cloning an existing repository. The other helpful thing about this section is it shows you exactly how to work this program on a different system such as Mac or Windows.</p>
